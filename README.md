# ***Mock Storefront***

---------------------------------
---------------------------------

## Web Application

A basic storefront app for selling products from multiple categories.

The app demonstrates the use of Redux to manage global app state outside of React. The app pulls its inventory and product categories from an API. Products can be filtered by category. Items added to the cart are removed from inventory. Items removed from card are returned to inventory. There is space for each product to have an image and a description, as well as pricing information and available quantity.
